## Introduction

Afterglow is (yet another) roleplaying framework/gamemode for Garry's Mod very similar in execution to [Eternity](https://github.com/TacoNBanana/eternity-public) and [CombineControl](https://github.com/TacoNBanana/combinecontrol-public) with a few key differences:

- It's built from the ground up to be open source and public, instead of being developed for internal use only.
- By separating the core from the content/plugins, it makes it easier to adapt to different settings as you don't have to get 'into the weeds' to pull some of the setting-specific stuff out.
- It aims (and so far) avoids some of the pitfalls that I fell into with Eternity like the amount of unnecessary data that was networked to each player.
- It's built with another several years of experience designing, maintaining and just writing glua code in general under my belt.

With it being effectively identical in (overall) design to CombineControl it has some notable differences when compared to something like [Helix](https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix):

- It doesn't use schemas.
- The overall look of the gamemode is a lot less refined, especially the user interface with next to no animations or fancy designs.
- The code itself is probably less refined, but it should be easier for people to get in there and get their hands dirty.

## Installation

Requires [MySQLOO](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO), more detailed instructions will be added later when things are more stable and ready for general use.
